// Welcome coders! Your challenge.. should you choose to accept it, is to write a function named 'uppercase' 
// It should take a string as its input, and return the first letter of every word in that string as uppercase.

// Examples:
// uppercase("this is the best test ive ever seen") => "This Is The Best Test Ive Ever Seen"
// uppercase("room 8 make the best tests") => "Room 8 Make The Best Tests"

// When you think your function is ready to be put to the test, open the terminal and run the command 'npm test' to see how you did.
// Success?? Great Job! Try to think of other methods of completing the test, and how you could refactor your code to make it even better!
// Failed?? Have a look at the code and the expected result, to see what it is tring to test, and try again!

// If you try to input a number as the input of the function, it should throw and error stating 'Input must be a string'

export default function uppercase(str) {
}
console.log(uppercase());
