# Hackathon Week 6 - Codewars style challenge

Our latest Hackathon challenge was to culminate all of our learning for this week and create tests indivdually, similar to how you find them on codewars.

 


Working Together

Each of us were given our own individual repo on github, with a test.js file and .js file, along with the accompanying docs required. It was up to us to come up with, create, and implement these tests on our own accord. 

We planned out our ideation together as a team, coming up with a theme we wanted, (to stay consistent with the testing) and discussed the structure, what they should look like, and how hard they should be to complete.

After our ideation phase was complete, it was time to start coding! We knew what test we needed to create and we knew we had the knowledge to succeed, so we got to it! We used pair-programming by having regular stand-ups, checking on eachothers progress and assisting to de-bug where necessary.

## Running our tests!

To run the tests we have wrote, we reccomend you to do the following:

- Clone our repo's from our invdividual github profiles
- Open the file in vscode, and in the terminal enter

```bash
    run npm install
```
- At this point, its up to you! Take a look through the main.test.js file to try and understand what the tests are asking you to do, and try to create a function that follows and passes the test!
- When you think you are ready and the function is complete,

```bash
    run npm test
```
Check your results! Did you pass? if so, try to think of a way to refactor the code and see if you can pass again!

Did you fail? if so, why? read through the error messages and check what needs to be corrected!
